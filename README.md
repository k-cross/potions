# Potions

This is a side project that's meant to demonstrate the phoenix framework, elixir, and react as a front-end technology.

## Notes

### Secrets

Many of these example projects are programmed without security in mind, so there are embedded passwords and other secrets.
If you plan to use these as examples, they will not work as all embedded secrets are changed before the examples are made public.
If you plan to use this code in production, you are stupid.

### Actor Concurrency Model

Think of actors like a purer form of object orientation, where actors are a lot like objects.

* An _actor_ is a _process_
* Earch process has a specific task
* Controlling a process is done through message passing
* Messages are _pattern-matched_
* Processes don't share information in any other way

## Algorithms

* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## Examples

* Converter
    * This mainly demonstrates guards
* ID3
    * This demonstrates some pattern matching features
