# Potions

This is a side project that's meant to demonstrate the phoenix framework, elixir, and react as a front-end technology.

## Notes

### Actor Concurrency Model

Think of actors like a purer form of object orientation, where actors are a lot like objects.

* An _actor_ is a _process_
* Earch process has a specific task
* Controlling a process is done through message passing
* Messages are _pattern-matched_
* Processes don't share information in any other way

## Algorithms

* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## Examples

* Converter
    * This mainly demonstrates guards
* ID3
    * This demonstrates some pattern matching features
